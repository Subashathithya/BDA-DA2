ABSTRACT

In the rapidly evolving landscape of e-commerce, understanding customer behavior is crucial for enhancing user experience and optimizing marketing strategies. This study employs Self-Organizing Maps (SOM), a type of unsupervised neural network, to perform customer segmentation based on purchasing behavior. Using a dataset of e-commerce transactions, we first preprocess the data by filtering relevant features such as unique products purchased and unique categories engaged with by customers.

We then apply Min-Max scaling to normalize these features, followed by training the SOM to uncover distinct customer segments characterized by their purchasing patterns. Visualization of the SOM allows for intuitive identification of customer clusters, facilitating insights into varying customer behaviors.

Furthermore, we build a neural network to classify new customers into these segments, enabling personalized marketing approaches. The analysis reveals significant trends and patterns that can guide e-commerce businesses in targeting their marketing efforts more effectively, thereby enhancing customer satisfaction and loyalty. The findings underscore the potential of SOM in deriving actionable insights from complex customer data, providing a robust framework for segmentation in the e-commerce sector.
