ABSTRACT:

In the rapidly evolving landscape of e-commerce, understanding customer behavior is crucial for enhancing user experience and optimizing marketing strategies. This study employs Self-Organizing Maps (SOM), a type of unsupervised neural network, to perform customer segmentation based on purchasing behavior. Using a dataset of e-commerce transactions, we first preprocess the data by filtering relevant features such as unique products purchased and unique categories engaged with by customers.

We then apply Min-Max scaling to normalize these features, followed by training the SOM to uncover distinct customer segments characterized by their purchasing patterns. Visualization of the SOM allows for intuitive identification of customer clusters, facilitating insights into varying customer behaviors.

Furthermore, we build a neural network to classify new customers into these segments, enabling personalized marketing approaches. The analysis reveals significant trends and patterns that can guide e-commerce businesses in targeting their marketing efforts more effectively, thereby enhancing customer satisfaction and loyalty. The findings underscore the potential of SOM in deriving actionable insights from complex customer data, providing a robust framework for segmentation in the e-commerce sector.

The E-commerce Behavior Data from a Multi-Category Store dataset contains detailed information on user behavior across various product categories in an e-commerce platform. The dataset tracks key user actions such as:

Product Views: Monitoring when users view products.

Cart Additions: Tracking items that users add to their shopping carts.

Purchases: Recording transactions when users purchase products.

This dataset is ideal for conducting customer segmentation based on behavioral patterns like browsing, purchasing frequency, and product preferences. It is particularly useful for tasks such as customer journey analysis, building recommendation systems, and marketing strategy optimization.

TO HOW TO EXECUTE THE CODE:

To successfully implement customer segmentation using **Self-Organizing Maps (SOM)** in an e-commerce context, there are specific software and hardware requirements that must be addressed for an efficient workflow.

### **Software Requirements:**

1. **Development Environment**:
   - **Google Colab** or **Jupyter Notebook** are highly recommended platforms. These environments offer easy access to essential libraries, particularly in Python. Google Colab also has the advantage of free GPU access, making it easier to train neural networks more quickly.

2. **Python Version**:
   - A **Python 3.x** environment is necessary to ensure compatibility with modern libraries used for data manipulation, machine learning, and visualization.

3. **Libraries**:
   - **Pandas**: Used for data manipulation, including loading datasets and performing data cleaning and preprocessing.
   - **NumPy**: Essential for numerical operations, matrix manipulations, and efficient handling of large datasets.
   - **Matplotlib**: Useful for data visualization, including visualizing customer segments and SOM outputs.
   - **Minisom**: A specialized library designed for implementing and training SOMs in Python.
   - **Scikit-learn**: Required for data preprocessing, normalization, and splitting datasets for training and validation.
   - **Keras**: If you plan to extend the segmentation with deep learning techniques, Keras will help you build neural networks to enhance the analysis.

### **Hardware Requirements:**

1. **Processor**:
   - A **dual-core CPU with at least 8 GB of RAM** is the minimum requirement to run small to medium-sized datasets effectively. This configuration is sufficient for initial model building and testing.
   - For handling **larger datasets** more effectively (e.g., e-commerce behavior data with millions of rows), a **quad-core processor** with at least **16 GB of RAM** is recommended. This setup will ensure faster data processing and model training.

2. **GPU**:
   - While a **GPU** is not mandatory, having one significantly boosts the performance when training more complex neural networks or working with deep learning extensions of SOM. A GPU can reduce training time drastically, making it possible to scale up with larger datasets.
   - **Google Colab** offers free access to GPUs, which is a convenient and cost-effective option for faster model training.

### **Execution Environment**:
Meeting these software and hardware specifications is crucial for carrying out a successful customer segmentation project. By ensuring you have access to the necessary tools and computational power, you will be able to effectively leverage the capabilities of SOMs for clustering large datasets of e-commerce user behavior.

Using SOMs, you can segment customers based on factors such as **purchase history**, **browsing behavior**, and **cart interactions**. This segmentation is invaluable in optimizing marketing strategies, improving customer retention, and offering personalized recommendations to different customer segments.
